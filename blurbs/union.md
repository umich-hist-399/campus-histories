# The Michigan Union

Easily one of the most recognizable buildings on campus, the Michigan Union has a rich history. When first opened in 1919, it was a private club for male students with an annual membership fee (Bates 1905, 2). The Union provided a social space for students and included a billiards room, bowling alley and even a barber shop. Members could stop by the Union for a hot meal, or to meet with colleagues. Originally women were not permitted entrance to the building unaccompanied. They had to enter through the East Entrance with a male escort. In 1954, women were gained access to the building through the front entrance, but were not granted access to the entire building until 1968 (Bordin 1999, 82).
