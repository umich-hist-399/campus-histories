# The Michigan Zoo

From 1929 until 1962, students could visit the "Animal House" on the way to class.
- The zoo occupied a space that was once part of the Fletcher Farm (Pettibone 1854). After which, the property was acquired by Dr. Ransom Smith, who built a house upon it.
- After his death, the property was donated to the University of Michigan. The house was first used by the university as a Nurses' Home for the Homeopathic Medical School, where nurses would live while working and studying at the hospital (McRae 1901).
- In 1929, the zoo was built behind the Alexander G. Ruthven Museums Building for the purpose of zoological study (Ruthven 1929, 5). Among the kinds of animals housed there were black bears, foxes, racoons, and bobcats
- A year later, an addition with a large pool of water made space for turtles and snakes.
- **After an experiment gone wrong, the zoo even housed our mascot, a live wolverine named Biff.** It was acquired by Yost in 1927, who thought that a real wolverine would be exciting for fans attending games. Unfortunately, the wolverine is a very viscious animal by nature, and had it out for his handlers. When placed in a cage before the game, he snapped a bar in half with his teeth and Yost soon realized that his plans to walk Biff around the stadium with a leash may be slightly problematic.
- The museum was widely popular amongst students, but it was controversial due to the small cages it held large animals in. In 1962, it had to be demolished to make space for the East wing expansion of the Alexander G. Ruthven Museums Building (Wason 2014).
