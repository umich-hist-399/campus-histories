# C.C. Little Building

_The Clarence Cook Little Building represents much than a bus destination_

- Built in 1925 for the medical school by famed Detroit and Ann Arbor architect Albert Kahn who designed many buildings on campus.
- Now houses many Natural Sciences departments. (Department of Microbiology box 1951-1979).
- The building is situated on the northeast corner of the original parameters of the [Central Campus Diag](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/essays/diag). The building is constructed in a triangular shape on the corner and features Ionic columns and a brick facade.
- Named after Clarence Cook Little, University of Michigan president from 1925-1929. (Meer, 2017).
- There has been recent controversy over the naming rights to this building as its namesake supported eugenics during his lifetime. (Meer, 2017). This controversy comes in the midst of a climate of ongoing between the public and the University over who has the right to name buildings that affect many people logistically and emotionally. (Meer, 2017).
- “C.C. Little” is also the site of a major bus stop all University and many Ann Arbor buses. (Meer, 2017).
