- Built in 1925 for the medical school by famed Detroit and Ann Arbor architect Albert Kahn who designed many buildings on campus.
- Now houses many Natural Sciences departments. (Department of Microbiology box 1951-1979).
- The building is situated on the northeast corner of the original parameters of the [Central Campus Diag](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/essays/diag). The building is constructed in a triangular shape on the corner and features Ionic columns and a brick facade.
- Named after Clarence Cook Little, University of Michigan president from 1925-1929, in the first year of his term (VanEyck 1965; "Inauguration of Clarence Cook Little..." 1925).
- There has been recent controversy over the naming rights to this building as its namesake supported eugenics during his lifetime. (Meer, 2017). This controversy comes in the midst of a climate of ongoing between the public and the University over who has the right to name buildings that affect many people logistically and emotionally. (Meer, 2017; VanEyck 1965).
- “C.C. Little” is also the site of a major bus stop all University and many Ann Arbor buses. (Meer, 2017).
- As seen below, the C.C. Little Building has ample research and laboratory facilities as well as lecture hall space, classrooms and offices for professors.
- While many students may walk by the C.C. Little building everyday and not give it a second thought, this architecturally and historically significant structure has a curious history and is worth exploring as it approaches its one hundredth birthday ([Clarence Cook Little Papers] 1924).
