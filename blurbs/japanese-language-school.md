## The Japanese Language School

Before WWII, in the United States, Japanese was not a widely taught language. By 1942, this lack of people who could understand and speak Japanese became a major issue for the United States Army. To solve this problem, the University of Michigan in conjunction with the United States founded the Army Japanese Language in 1943 under the direction of Professor Joseph Yamagiwa (Williams 1995, 10). Thus, on January 5th, 1943, 150 officers arrived on campus to be the first students of the University’s Japanese Language School (Yamagiwa 1946, 9).

Soldiers needed to learn the language as soon as possible, so that they could fill the many roles their new skill was needed for. To accommodate for this lack of time, courses were structured so that students could become proficient enough in as little as a year (Yamagiwa 1946, 181). To promote the language, these accelerated courses were offered to civilian students as well.

Before WWII, language courses at the University of Michigan were offered for the standard 3 credits("War Training Program" 1941). With the onset of the Japanese Language School, accelerated courses were offered for 4 to 8 credits (Yamagiwa 1946, 2). This was a popular option during the war, because it allowed students to complete credits faster. Thus, this structure was kept after the war was over and applied to other languages. This is the first example of the accelerated course options that exist today being offered at the University.

**This accelerated structure gave birth to the credit system for languages that is still in use at Michigan.** Today, language classes are offered for a standard 4 credits a semester, and an accelerated 8 credits. Without the onset of WWII, students today may not have had the option to take the accelerated courses that allow them to graduate earlier. They also may not have even had the opportunity to study the Japanese language at all.
