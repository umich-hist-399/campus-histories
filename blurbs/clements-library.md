# William L. Clements Library

The Clements library is named for a former regent of the University of Michigan, William L. Clements. In 1921, Clements arranged to donate his extensive collection of rare books and manuscripts to the university and commission the construction of a new library to house it.

Albert Kahn, a prominent Detroit-based architect of German origin with was chosen to design the building. At that time, Kahn had already designed seven buildings on the University of Michigan Campus: the Engineering Building (later West Hall,) the Psychopathic Hospital (since demolished,) Hill Auditorium, the Helen Newberry Residence Hall, the Natural Science Building, the Betsey Barbour Residence Hall, and the University of Michigan General Library (now Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library.)

Clements insisted that library was to be designed in the style of late-fifteenth-century Italian architecture, so as to mimic the features popular in Genoa at the time of Columbus’ disembarkation on the voyage that would lead him to discover the Americas.

Following Clements’ instructions, Kahn designed a regal Indiana limestone structure in the elegant style of the Italian Renaissance. Three rounded archways marked the entrance to the building, and the front lawn was to feature a sweeping terrace and flower garden.

The interior of the building contained  a main atrium, two offices, a reading room, and a rare books room. The rare books room was designed like a vault, to protect against theft. The lower level of the library featured several rooms for maps, newspapers, reference materials, restrooms, a lounge, and custodian’s quarters.

The Clements collection originally consisted mostly of Americana as well as maps and documents from colonial North America.
