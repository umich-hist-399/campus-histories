# Yost Ice Arena

Originally called the Yost Field House, it was completed in 1923 and was initially primarily used for football, baseball, basketball, and track athletics. The building itself is 365 feet by 165 feet, and had a total floor space of over 87,000 square feet. The huge dimensions and excess of space allowed for year-round training at the facility. The cost of the fully equipped facility was over $500,000, and it was built in the spirit of Italian Romanesque.

The field house was dedicated to the University on November 10, 1923, and the athletic teams soon took full advantage of the indoor facilities due to the winter. The facility was built with the funds from the highly successful athletic program and was named after Fielding Harris Yost, the coach of the football team from 1901 to 1924 and the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics from 1921 until 1941.

In 1973, the facility was remolded into an ice arena, and it was renamed the Yost Ice Arena. The renovations cost over $500,000 and were paid by the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. Since it became an ice arena, it has been the home for the hockey team for over 40 seasons.
