# Ferry Field

## The students want to play outside!

Early in the life of the University, there was *very little space available for the students to use for recreational athletics.* In 1856, a manual exercises building was built, and it was later upgraded into a gymnasium. The class of 1870 gifted another gymnasium to the University that would be built just south of South Hall. Another recreational center, originally called the Old Rink, was built in 1885. It is currently known as the Armory.

However, there was a serious lack of outdoor recreational facilities. It wasn't until 1865 when the University appropriated **just** $50 for the creation of a cricket field. The University continued to lack adequate outdoor facilities until the Regents decided in 1890 to buy ten acres for $3,000. This plot of land would be called Regents Field, and it included a quarter-mile track, a baseball diamond, and a football field.

Dexter Ferry, a business man from Detroit, bought an additional seventeen acres north of Regents Field in 1902, and it was renamed Ferry Field. The football team played here for many years. The stands there could hold just 1,500 fans, *so as football got more popular,* a new stadium had to be built. After the football team left Ferry Field for [Michigan Stadium](essays/michigan-stadium), it became the home for the Michigan Track and Field team.
