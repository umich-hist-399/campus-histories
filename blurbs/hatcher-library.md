# Harlan Hatcher Library

 Out of the six buildings included in the Universityâ€™s initial building plan, a library was not one of them.  Instead, space for a library was made in the University Main building. Before a library was made, the university moved the books around to wherever it is most convenient, and often times the reading areas were crowded. In 1863, the library was moved to the law building and stayed there for 20 years until it was asked to move out of concern for lack of space for the Law department.

 To accommodate the growing student population at the University, the Michigan Legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a library for the University. The library, originally known as the General Library, was completed in 1883 and contained 43,366 volumes when it opened.  Within four years, the library reached capacity for the amount of volumes it can hold, so additions had to be made. Now known as the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library, the new library was completed in 1920, and the additions created room for a thousand readers and over a million volumes.
