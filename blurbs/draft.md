## Students and the Selective Service System

- 1965 was a grim year for students at the University of Michigan and people around the United States that opposed the Vietnam War. In March, the United States entered the Vietnam War despite the fact that the government never made an official declaration of war (Lawrence 2008, 8). For the entirety of U.S. involvement in the war, students protested.

- In 1966, **"University students picketed the home of University President Harlan Hatcher in protest of cooperation with the Selective Service System"** ("Selective Service Praised, Protested, Reviewed" 1966).

- The first Teach-In happened as a response to the Vietnam War on the Michigan Campus (Zweig 1965). Today, Teach-Inâ€™s are held nationwide as a form of educational protest.

- On October 15th, 1965, University of Michigan students participated in a nation Sit-In of Selective Service offices. 39 people were arrested by the Ann Arbor Police, of which 36 were sentenced to 10 days in jail and a fine ("Arrest 39 Protesters" 1965).

- 15 of the protestors were reclassified to 1A, which meant they were likely to be drafted. **After this incident, the University released a statement in support of the students** ("U Statement Opposes Punative Action in Draft Status Changes" 1965).

- Despite the efforts to end the Selective Service Program, the draft continued throughout the war, though registration was suspended in 1975. For young men who were eligable, the draft lottery was met with much emotion ("Lottery Fixes Order for Draft" 1969). In 1980, Selective Service was reinstated and remains intact today ("Background of Selective Service").
