# The Engineering Arch

{% include figure.html class="img-center" width="50%" caption="The Arch, 1921" src="/images/arch-6.jpg" %}

- Built in 1904 as part of the new engineering building, later renamed ‘West Engineering’ on the southeast corner of the original campus ('New Engineering Building')
- Over the years, the Arch has been named the "Denison Archway", the "Engineering Arch" and the solely the "Arch." ('New Engineering Building")
- Named after [Charles Denison](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/essays/um-expansion-east), an engineering professor at the time who recognized the need to build an arch in order to accommodate the Diag.
- Today, the Arch holds significance as a site of campus lore.
- There is a campus myth/lore that any couple who kisses underneath the Arch at midnight, once a boundary between the men’s dorms and the [women’s dorms](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/essays/social-training) to northeast, will marry one day.
- This myth is very popular and is regularly featured on [“Best College Myths”](http://collegetraditions.blogspot.com/2012/11/university-of-michigan-m-legend.html) and [“Best College Romantic Legends”](http://www.collegeranker.com/features/most-romantic-college-traditions/) lists
- The Arch is also a popular thoroughfare for students walking to and from class as well as a frequent campus tour attraction.
- In the underside of the top of the arch, there are three archaic symbols. While their exact origin is unknown, University officials believe the symbols represent the three letters of the engineering society, Tau Beta Pi (Harold H. Perry scrapbook 1912). Dating methods estimate the glyphs to be over 100 years old (Tau Beta Pi records 1906).
- Paying homage to its engineering roots, in addition to the Greek letters of Tau Beta Pi, today, the Arch is flanked by the department of Naval Architecture and the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory (Herman Samuel Sherman papers).
