# The Engineering Arch

- Built in 1904 as part of the new engineering building, later renamed ‘West Engineering’
- Named after Charles Denison, an engineering professor at the time who recognized the need to build an arch in order to accommodate the Diag.
- Today, the Arch holds significance as a site of campus lore.
- There is a campus myth/lore that any couple who kisses underneath the Arch at midnight [once the separation between where men’s dorms were located versus the women’s to northeast] will marry one day.
- This myth is very popular and is regularly featured on “Best College Myths” and “Best College Romantic Legends” lists
- The Arch is also a popular thoroughfare for students walking to and from class as well as a frequent campus tour attraction.
