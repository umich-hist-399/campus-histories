# Rackham School of Graduate Studies

- Construction funded by Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham in 1935 with a gift of  more than $10 million dollars ("A Historical Tour of the University of Michigan campus, 2007")
- Prior to construction, 30 buildings had to be demolished including noted early twentieth century student eating club, “Freeman’s.” (_The Michigan Alumnus_, November 12, 1938, page 101).
- Architecturally designed to face Hatcher Graduate Library, inspired by the plan of the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
- Now serves as a school for graduate students seeking master’s degrees and Ph.D’s in a number of disciplines and as a space for lectures and talks.
- In 1955, Dr. Thomas Francis of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and University of Michigan Polio Evaluation Center announced that the vaccine for polio developed by Dr. Jonas Salk was effective from the Rackham auditorium. After a year of clinical trials and decades of afflicted patients, this highly-anticipated announcement represented a breakthrough in scientific innovation and changed the course of countless lives (Thomas Francis papers).
