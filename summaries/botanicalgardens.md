# The Botanical Gardens

## Founded in 1907, the Botanical Gardens are truly mobile, from its initial beginnings on campus, then moving near Ypsilanti, then finally its eventual home east of where it first began.

When the University of Michigan was founded in 1817, the law provided that the governing board should be able to provide “useful literary and scientific institutions”, and “botanic gardens” were one of these (Bartlett, 506). Thus began a process which would last for the rest of the 19th century; planting the Botanical Gardens. The first sign of progress came on June 5, 1837, U of M’s Ann Arbor birthday. That day, the Regents appointed Asa Gray as professor of botany, and in 1838 he helped draw up the original campus development plan of U of M (Bartlett, 506). A map of the university campus from 1854 shows that the eastern half was “botanic gardens”, but it is not clear whether or not they were there. By 1868, desire for the gardens to be planted was stirred up once again, and in 1897, finally, the first seeds were planted on the campus itself (Bartlett, 506).

It was difficult to maintain the Gardens on the campus, so in 1899 the search for other spaces began. In 1906, “Dr. and Mrs. Walter H. Nichols offered a tract of about twenty-seven acres between Geddes Avenue and the Huron River for the Botanical Gardens.” (Bartlett, 507) Additional gifts of 25 and 30 acres were secured shortly afterwards, bringing the total land allotment of the Botanical Gardens to 80 acres. In January 1907, the Regents officially accepted this land and founded the Botanical Garden & Arboretum [(Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum History)](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/mbg/about/history.asp). However, there were numerous complaints from University botanists about this area. The land was too hilly and peppered with ravines to support “experimental cultures” and “systematic gardens” (Bartlett, 507). As such, a committee was formed to procure an alternate tract of land for botanical and research purposes, and in 1915 the Botanical Gardens were moved to an area near a road called Iroquois Street, near the Ypsilanti city line (Bartlett, 508; Norman, 1).

During the era of World War I, the Botanical Gardens were used for production of “drug plants”, in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies. In 1919, this activity became incredibly lucrative, and most of the Gardens were dedicated to the production of these plants, “with no commensurate gain to science”. (Bartlett, 509) Professor Kraemer, who was in charge of the operation, wanted to continue the growing of these drug  plants as a purely commercial venture after the war; this request was denied.

Following this wartime period, the chief activity in the Botanical Gardens pertained to research and support for instruction in botany. During WWII, a similar arrangement to WWI ensued, and plots of the Gardens were “victory gardens” (Norman, 1). By 1955, the Iroquois location of the Gardens came to be unfavorable, as it became a high-traffic area, encroaching upon the Gardens’ nature area. An area on Dixboro Road 5 miles from campus was chosen as the new home, and a gift of 200 acres was given by Mr. and Mrs. Frederick C. Matthaei. (Norman, 2)

The new site was dedicated in 1962, and in April 1969 it was renamed the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, in honor of the generous benefactors. To this day, the Gardens remain on this site, and remain committed to “providing connections between the University and the broader public, sharing research and providing learning opportunities, using our gardens and natural lands to demonstrate how to protect and manage biological integrity, and demonstrating principles of sustainability in our facilities and lands—helping people redefine their own relationship to nature.” [(A Century of Growing 1907-2007)](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/mbg/files/MBGNA_History.pdf)
