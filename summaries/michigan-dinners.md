- Over 1,100 men attended the first official Michigan Dinner that was held on November 11, 1904. It "afforded to the University Body its first opportunity of expressing itself unitedly and understandingly in favor of a plan which presented itself to all as Michigan's greatest need." (Bates 1905, 2).

- That need was a formal social club for all Michigan Men around the world. Thus, it was at this dinner, that the idea for the Michigan Union was formally announced (Bates 1905, 2).

- By the second annual Michigan dinner, the [Michigan Union](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/essays/union) was already a well established club on campus, but the founders wanted the Michigan Union to reach the alumni base (Bates 1905, 3).

- The Michigan Dinner quickly became the most sought after banquet to attend on campus, because it allowed students and faculty to meet on common ground, outside of the classroom ("University of Michigan Union", 1914). The event was meant to be a night where all Michigan men were on a level playing field and could unite in their common loyalty to the University ("University of Michigan Union" 1914, 14).

- As the Michigan Union grew, the Michigan Dinner became a way for Alumni to connect with each other, as well as faculty and current students (Rowe 2004). In 1927, the first off campus Michigan Dinner was hosted in Chicago by alumni in the area. This dinner is also the first in which women are listed in attendance ("Chicago Alumni Complete Plans for Michigan Dinner at Chicago" 1927).

- As the years went on, the event seemed to be dwindling in popularity, because it was often held in cities far away from campus. This made it hard for current students and faculty to attend the dinner. Only 300 people attended the 1930 dinner in Boston, though it was advertised as a can't-miss event ("Alumni to Gather for Celebration" 1930).

- Like many other traditions, Michigan Dinners ceased during [World War II](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/summaries/world-war-two) and were never reinstated. It was already becoming harder and harder to get alumni together, and during the war it was even harder. The Michigan Dinner may have came to an end, but it ended with a bang (Williams 1995).

- The 1939 Michigan Dinner is the last recorded. It was held to honor President Ruthvenâ€™s 10th year as head of the University. With over 3,500 people and a pageant with 1,000 members, it was the largest Michigan Dinner ever put on ("3500 Will Acclaim President Ruthven At Dinner Tonight" 1939).

- Today, students have a much more casual opportunity to share a free meal with professors through the "Take Your Professor or GSI to Lunch" program ("Students, Professors Share Free Lunch" 2003).
