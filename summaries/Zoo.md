# The Michigan Zoo

From 1929 until 1962, students could visit the campus zoo on the way to class. The zoo occupied a space that was once part of the Fletcher Farm (Pettibone 1854). After which, the property was acquired by Dr. Ransom Smith, who built a house upon it. After his death, the property was donated to the University of Michigan. The house was used as a Nurses' Home for the Homeopathic Medical School, where nurses would live while working and studying at the hospital (McRae 1901). In 1929, the zoo was built behind the Alexander G. Ruthven Museums Building for the purpose of zoological study (Ruthven 1929, 5). Among the kinds of animals housed there were black bears, foxes, racoons, bobcats, and even a wolverine. A year later, an addition with a large pool of water made space for turtles and snakes. The museum was widely popular amongst students, but unfortunately it had to be demolished in 1962 to make space for the East wing expansion of the Alexander G. Ruthven Museums Building (Wason 2014).
