# President’s House

-The initial building plan of the University of Michigan called for two buildings for class and student use, and four buildings to house professors and other university faculty.

-Henry Phillip Tappan was made the first president of the University of Michigan in 1852, and he moved into the southwest house with his family. After he moved into, the name remained, The President’s House. During his presidency, a third floor was added to the house.

-President Tappan was not reinstated in 1863, instead, Erastus Haven, a professor at the University was named the next President. After he moved into the President’s house with his family, he asked for a new kitchen to be built, because the previous one had an “unseemly odor”.

-President Haven left in 1869 for Northwestern University, and Henry Frieze became President pro tempore while search continued for a new President, with Frieze declining the initial offer. President Frieze choose to note move into the President’ House, instead he stayed in his house, the Professor’s house down the street.

-James Angell, then the president of University of Vermont, became the next president of the University but only after long negotiations. Many of the concerns that Angell had were with the President’s house which did not live up to the standards that his family was accustomed to.

-During Angell’s 39 years of presidency, many additions were made to the house including a west wing that added a library and more bedrooms.  Also during this time, the house was wired for electricity. Angell eventually resigned in 1909 when the regents accepted his resignation 4 years after it was submitted, and he continued to live in the house until his death in 1916.

-After Angell’s resignation, dean of the Law School, Harry Burns Hutchins took up the presidency in 1910. Being the only president to not live in the President’s house, Burns served as president until 1920.

-Marion LeRoy Burton from the University of Minnesota was selected to be Hutchin’s successor after his retirement. President Burton requested that renovations be made to the house before his family moved in, so a sun parlor was added to the east side and the back porch was made into an enclosed dining area.

-The President’s House is still used today to house the University President and his family. The originally built part of the President’s House stands as one of the oldest buildings on campus.
