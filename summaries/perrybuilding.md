{% include figure.html class="img-center" width="50%" src="/images/perry-building.jpg" %}

- Currently houses the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (established 1962), a center that “maintains and provides access to a vast archive of social science data for research and instruction”
- Formerly known as Perry School
- There is also a Perry School (the former Perry Nursery School of Ann Arbor), on Packard near Carpenter, now called Foundations Preschool of Washtenaw County.
- This building began as an elementary school and was named after Lawrence Perry, Ypsilanti's (neighboring town of Ann Arbor) first African American school board member.
- The aforementioned Perry School was funded by the Depression-era WPA in 1934, as the Perry Elementary School at Packard and Madison
- The building was named for Walter S. Perry, a former Ann Arbor superintendent of schools.
- It built a reputation as an excellent school dedicated to serving one-parent families.
- During World War II, Perry Elementary got funding under the Lanham Act, created to make it possible for mothers to work in the defense industry.
- Following the war, community activists organized to keep the school in operation, under the realization that a need for the school remained as there were many single women, divorced or widowed.
- In the heyday of Perry Elementary, unplanned pregnancies were prevalent due to the absence of the availability of birth control pills and the timing (prior to the women's liberation movement) when dropping out of school and quick and short marriages followed by low-paying employment was the norm
- The school later became a United Way Agency to serve low income and at risk families

- The on-campus location afforded easier access to recruit additional help from University students studying education, psychology and nursing.
- Eventually, costs to maintain the school became too high for the nonprofit United Way and the school was put up for sale.
- The University bought the Perry building in 1967
- The school moved operations to a location on the outer reaches of Ann Arbor which it credits to increasing its reach for parents from outside Ann Arbor.
