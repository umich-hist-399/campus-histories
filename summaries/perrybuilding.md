## A school with ties to FDR's WPA project

The Water S. Perry Building, located at 330 Packard Road on the southern edge of U-M's Ann Arbor campus, currently houses the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (established 1962), a center that â€œmaintains and provides access to a vast archive of social science data for research and instruction," (ISR website). This building is named for Walter S. Perry, a former Ann Arbor superintendent of schools. While the University of Michigan purchased the school in 1967, part of a trend by the University to [purchase local public schools](https://umich-hist-399.github.io/campus-histories/essays/acq-public-schools) in order to accomodate its growing needs, the building has a long history and acts as a touchpoint to many significant events in the twentieth century.

Before going further, it is important to acknowledge and differentiate the Walter S. Perry from the other "Perry School" in the area.In the neighboring city Ypsilanti, there is a school known as Lawrence Perry, named for Ypsilanti's first African American school board member. Today the Lawrence Perry building is called Foundations Preschool of Washtenaw County.

With funding under President Roosevelt's WPA Project, Ann Arbor built the Walter S. Perry Elementary School in 1934. Quickly garnering  a reputation as an excellent school, this schoo specialized in serving one-parent families. At time went on, Perry Elementary received further funding under the Lanham Act. Established in 1940, the Lanham Act authorized "war-related government grants [and] childcare services  in communities contributing to defense production," (Cohen 2015). Under this program, the United States federal government spent close to $1 billion (adjusted for inflation) opening and updating schools in 49 states, reaching estimates of 600,000 children (Cohen 2015). With their children in school or daycare and their husbands overseas, this program was designed to encourage women to enter the workforce on the homefront related to the war effort. Additionally, this greatly helped single or widowed mothers as it provided childcare and an opportunity to support the family in a single income household. As Rhaina Cohen of _The Atlantic_ notes, "For the first and, to date, only time in American history, parents could send their children to federally-subsidized childcare, regardless of income." While the program ended after the war, community activists in the area organized to keep the school in operation, recognizing that the need for the school did not cease like the war on VJ Day. 

As a school specializing in serving low-income or at-risk families, many of the students were the children of single women who were either divorced or widowed. In this era, many women had unplanned pregnancies due to the absence of the availability of safe birth control pills. As a result, many women dropped out of school, which significantly decreased their chances of finding a good paying job, and found themselves in  quick and short marriages. In order to accomodate this needs, the school later became a United Way Agency.

In terms of staffing, the Perry School The on-campus location afforded easier access to recruit additional help from University students studying education, psychology and nursing. Eventually, costs to maintain the school became too high for the nonprofit United Way and the school was put up for sale. **The University bought the Perry building in 1967.** The school moved operations to a location on the outer reaches of Ann Arbor which it credits to increasing its reach for parents from outside Ann Arbor.
