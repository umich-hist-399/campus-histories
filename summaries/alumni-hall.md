# Alumni Hall and the Museum of Art

## Memorial for alumni transformed into Museum of Art

-In 1864 an idea to create an alumni memorial hall on campus for University men who passed during the Civil War was proposed. However, *even with the great deal of funds available for the project,* the idea was dropped within a couple of years.

-The idea was picked up again in 1903, when William N. Brown resurfaced the discussion of a University Alumni Hall. After a committee was formed and funds were secured, construction of Alumni Hall began in 1908 and was completed in 1910.

-Alumni Hall is a huge stone building supported by four classical pillars with great bronze doors at the entrance. Four of the rooms were named after the four largest donors. The large main gallery was named after Ezra Rust, the south upper galley after [Dexter M. Ferry](blurbs/ferry-field), the north upper gallery for Simon T. Murphy, and the lower north front room for Arthur Hill.

-The Hall eventually turned into a **center for Art** on the campus, as it initially opened with an art exhibit put together by Charles L. Freer. Since the opening of the Hall, the Ann Arbor Art Association help annual exhibits in the hall with events planned every year.

-Freerâ€™s exhibit was a composite, with two different sections. The exhibit had American and Oriental Art, and Freer wished to highlight the *similarities between the two different styles.*

-After the Museum of Art was moved from the Museum of Archaeology, Alumni Hall became the new home for the Museum in 1946.
