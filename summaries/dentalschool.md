# School of Dentistry

The University of Michigan was the first state university to open a school of dentistry.
Original building designated for the training of the dentist was built in 1909 on North University Avenue
Recognizing the need to expand, built a new expansion, the Kellogg Building in 1938.
Named to recognize the donation of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation that enabled its construction.
This expansion was built on the site of Prettyman’s Boarding House, a popular student eating and gathering place.
In a 1938 edition of The Michigan Alumnus, the author noted, “PRETT'S" is being torn down! The famous boarding house, of the triumvirate which one reigned at the top in student popularity in Ann Arbor for many undergraduate generations, is in the hands of the wreckers. It is being demolished to make way for the new Dental Building, which will occupy its site at the corner of North University Avenue and Twelfth Street, to the north of Barbour Gym.”
Renovations in 1971 by Smith, Hinchman & Grylls give the building its distinctive current look
There is a myth among students that the building is designed to look like a tooth.
Today offers academic programs in a wide variety of areas under the dentistry including a Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene undergraduate program, a Master’s program, a Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) designation as well as a Master in Science and Ph.D programs
