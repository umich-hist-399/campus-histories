# Waterman Gymnasium

As early as 1878, University students began to express interest in having a space on campus for recreational use apart from the official varsity athletic spaces
With the support of a number of donations and in spite of the Depression of 1893, the Waterman Gymnasium was completed 1894 for a cost of about $50,000.
It is located on the northeast corner of the original campus boundaries

Over the years, the facility was used for a variety of student activities such as exercise classes, class registration, a dance hall, a space for fundraising banquets and a space for barrack-like training for WWI soldiers
There was disagreement heading into the twentieth century regarding whether men and women should be permitted to use the building simultaneously or if a separate building should be built for women’s use, leading to the construction of the Barbour Gymnasium (1902).
The two gyms were constructed side by side.

Significant funding for the Barbour Gymnasium was provided by the Women’s League as the new space was to be designated for women’s use.
In addition to physical education, the Barbour Gymnasium was also used for social events and theater performances.
Both the Waterman and Barbour Gymnasiums were demolished in 1977 to make way for the expansion of the adjacent Chemistry building.
In the interim years before its demolition, usage of the Waterman Gymnasium declined as athletic activities were moved to the South Campus of the University.
