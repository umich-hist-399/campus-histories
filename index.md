Neglected but integral stories to campus history, focusing on the spatial interface between campus and the surrounding community.

## Our goal
Traditional university and campus histories rightfully celebrate growth, development, expansion, and progress. They enumerate great leaders, new buildings, new departments, and an ever-growing capacity for research, teaching, and learning.

But that is never the whole story. Here we offer a set of neglected but integral stories to campus history. In particular, we focus on people and places displaced by campus expansion---not as a condemnation of "progress" or a romanticization of a past---but to remember the invisible histories of a place that collectively define its identity.
