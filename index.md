## Our goal
Traditional university and campus histories tend to celebrate growth, development, expansion, and progress. They enumerate great leaders, new buildings, new departments, and an ever-growing capacity for research, teaching, and learning.

We offer a set of neglected but integral stories to campus history, focusing on the spatial interface between campus and the surrounding community. In particular, we focus on people and places displaced by campus expansion---not as a condemnation of "progress" or a romanticization of a past---but to remember the invisible histories of a place that collectively defined its identity,

While the ideal of an urban campus can be taken as a pastorl ideal, it must also be taken as a direct shaper of the urban environment. Yet the history of the interface between a university and its surroundings often falls into the shadows of institutional histories.

It raises questions about the role that historic architecture can play in creating a shared history of a place, etc.
