The contributions that the University of Michigan made to the war efforts during World War Two are well known, but what is lesser known are the ways that WWII left an impact on the university itself. Due to the nature of war, soldiers and civilians did not have the luxury of time. This lead to lasting changes in the University that can still be seen today.

## The Japanese Language School

Before WWII, Japanese was not a widely taught language in the United States. By 1942, this lack of people who could understand and speak Japanese became a major issue for the United States Army. To solve this problem, the Army Japanese Language School was started at the University in 1943 under the direction of Professor Joseph Yamagiwa (Williams 1995, 10). Thus, on January 5th, 1943, 150 officers arrived on campus to be the first students of the University’s Japanese Language School (Yamagiwa 1946, 9).

Soldiers needed to learn the language as soon as possible, so that could fill the many roles their new skill was needed for. To accommodate for this lack of time, courses were structured so that students could become proficient enough in as little as a yeat (Yamagiwa 1946, 181). These accelerated courses were offered to civilian students as well, as a way to promote the language.

Before WWII, language courses at the University of Michigan were offered for the standard 3 credits. With the onset of the Japanese Language School, accelerated courses were offered for 4 to 8 credits (Yamagiwa 1946, 2). This was a popular option during the war, because it allowed students to complete credits faster. Thus, the structure was kept after the end of the war and applied to other languages. This is the first example of accelerated course successfully being offerered at the University.

**This accelerated structure gave birth to the credit system for languages that is still in use at Michigan.** Today, Language classes are offered for a standard 4 credits a semester, and an accelerated 8 credits. Without the onset of WWII, students today may not have had the option to take the accelerated courses that allow them to graduate earlier. They also may not have even had the opportunity to study the Japanese language at all.

## NAME and the Navy

After the Great Depression, shipbuilding became almost obsolete, but WWII brought a resurgence to the market. The the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at Michigan (NAME) was one of the best in the country, and quickly became popular for training both Naval officers and civilians. Because people in this field were greatly needed, the curriculum for a bachelor degree was adjusted so that it could be completed in three years instead of four (“War Training Program” 1941).

This three-year approach had been used before, during World War One, but it had not yet been available outside of war time. Today, one can still meticulously arrange their schedule and be done in three years.

During the war, curriculum was largely focused on military application, which helped Michigan’s Naval Architecture program rise to the top. **Thus, in 1946, the Reserve Officers Naval Architecture Group (RONAG) was moved by the Navy from Annapolis to Ann Arbor (Greenbaum 1940).** This gave a new level of prestige to the program and left a lasting impact and cemented the relationship between the University and the Navy. NAME is still regarded as one of the best programs of its kind, and frequently works with the Navy.

An overlooked benefit of the heavy presence of the Navy on campus was the persistence of Varsity sports. While many schools had to discontinue their sports during the war years because of low civilian male enrollment, and rules restricting the military from participating in extracurricular activities, Michigan could keep them going (“About the University of Michigan, its work in peace and war” 1945, 18). This was due to the fact that the Navy was the only branch of the military that was allowed to participate in athletics (Williams 1995, 11). In part because the team was able to exist during the war years, for the years following WWII Michigan football was a force to be reckoned with.

## Women and the War

WWII brought many changes to not only to the lives of soldiers, but of civilians as well. On the University of Michigan campus, that meant that many things were forgone during wartime, but many opportunities were gained. With many men fighting the war, many jobs were left vacant and taken over by women. On campus, this provided many opportunities to women they previously had not had. One such opportunity was the ability to become an editor for the Michigan Daily and the Michiganensian (Williams 1995, 12).

Prior to 1940, you would be hard pressed to find a woman’s name under the list of editors for the Michigan Daily and the Michiganensian. Because they kept the papers afloat during the war however, they become common after it as well. **Today, there are many women who serve as editors for the Michigan Daily, who owe the opportunity to their counterparts in the 1940’s.**

One way that many female students contributed to the war effort during the war was by selling war bonds. They sold them in many places on campus, The Union being one of such places (Williams 1995, 12). **During war time, women were allowed to serve as busboys at the Union because of a shortage of men as well (Bordin 1999, xxix). This rose the question of why women were not allowed to enter themselves through the front door.**

After the war was over, many women who worked at the Union during the war expressed their desire to be able to enter the Union through the front door, without an escort. This raised a discussion amongst the leaders of the University, as it was a controversial point. Although many students were for women being allowed through the front doors, many were against it as well. **Finally, in 1954 women were allowed to enter through the front door of the Union, something that we take for granted today (Bordin 1999, 81).** Without the women who generously offered to fill roles where they were needed in the Union during WWII, that entry day may have came much later.

## Lasting Change

It is clear that many of the privileges that Michigan students and faculty enjoy today are the result of changes made during WWII. **While people often know that the campus operated differently during war time, they do not think of the legacy these changes left.** There is a common thought that after the war, Michigan went back to the way it was before it. That is not the case however, WWII left a lasting impact upon the University of Michigan that molded many programs and policies that students take for granted today.
