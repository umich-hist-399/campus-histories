# Ross School of Business

## The largest donation in school history. Twice!

-The building of a facility for the School of Business was approved in 1946, when the State of Michigan appropriated the funds of $1,800,000.

-The site in which it would be built was the block of land surrounded by the streets Monroe, Tappan, Hill, and Haven. To clear space for the building, ten houses were destroyed prior to the construction.

-Construction of the building began in August, 1946 but towards the end of it, the architects realized *that they would need more money to complete it.* More money to complete the building was appropriated in 1947.

-The architects of the building were Lee and Kenneth C. Black of Lansing, Michigan. By the fall of 1948, the south wing, library and administrative offices of the building were completed, with the remaining portion completed by the following February.

-After the building was completed, the total cost of it was over $2.7 million, including the furniture. The school had over 1,800,000 cubic feet in space. In the south wing were the classrooms and laboratories, and a library and lecture halls in the east wing. The library had space for 380 students and over 100,000 volumes in the stacks.

-In 2004, successful business man and Michigan Alumni, Stephen M. Ross, donated the sum of $100 million to the School of Business to upgrade it. The donation was the single largest to the University up to that moment. Shortly after, the university decided to rename the School to the Ross School of Business.

-Again in 2013, he donated another **$200 million** to the University, with half of it going to the Business School and the other half going to the athletic department. His donations broke another University record, making him the largest donor in University history.

-Some of the things his donations were used for included the creation of recruitment center which brought together students and hiring businesses, outfitting the classrooms with advanced technology and innovative design, and the creation of new facilities which would connect all of the buildings of Ross together to make a seamless campus. The money he donated would also be used for scholarships for Ross students.

-On the reasoning behind his donation, Ross said “The University of Michigan had a profound impact on my life and I have received *enormous satisfaction* from being able to give back to the institution that played such a crucial role in my success.”
