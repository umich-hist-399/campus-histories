# Writing Guide
This page provides a writing guide for the content you're creating. In it you'll find things to review and improve as you publish and revise your essays.

## Questions to keep in mind
- Who is our audience?
- What do they know?
- What do we want them to know?
- How do we want them to think differently?
- What kinds of design will encourage curiosity and exploration?

## Make Sure You Have
- Citations. Your research will not be published without them, and you will not get credit for them.
- Meaningful headings.
- No **bold** in your headings; use an appropriate heading level (as shown below). We can create new styles if need be.
- Informative first sentences that, in themselves, provide a clear progression through the essay.
- Consistent use of bold and italics, both throughout your essay and roughly compared to other essays. Don't use either too often, or it negates the effect of highlighting something. Do not use either for references; leave those as plain text.
- Images. Choose carefully to achieve the greatest effect and synergy with your essay.
- Pull Quotes and Sidebars. These typographic features help call attention to certain ideas that you want to highlight and provide a way of fast reading.

## Citations
We will use author date notation (Smith 1975, 13). Avoid citing webpages whenever possible; rather, find the original historical source. If you need to respond to something on the webpage itself (as opposed some historical source it discusses), you won't have a page number, but you'll still have author and date. If you can't find a date, be annoyed and  use "n.d." (for no date).

Be as specific and consistent as you can with your citations, even though some of your historical sources may make this difficult.

## Section Headings
For your reference, all the headings styles are demonstrated below. Remember that you must have a space between the ### and the actual heading!

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
```
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5


### Lists
``` md
- item 1
- item 2
  - put two spaces in front of your dash to sub-indent
- item 3
```
